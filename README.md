# Simon Game

Player must select the correct squares in the correct order.

Some people have trouble getting it, so here is an example:

* Press a keyboard button to start the game.
* The game selects the GREEN square. Player must click on the GREEN square.
* The game selects the BLUE square. Player must click on the GREEN square and THEN the BLUE square.
* The game selects the RED square. Player must again click all the previous squares in the right order (GREEN, then BLUE) and then RED.
* Follow the above pattern, everytime selecting all previous squares in the right order, plus the new one. 
* If it's "Game Over", player needs to press a keyboard button again to restart.

That's it. Have fun!
